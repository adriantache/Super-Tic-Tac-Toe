# Super-Tic-Tac-Toe
_A more complex (and fun) version of Tic Tac Toe using 9 boards_

As a way to get more practice with Java and Android development, I've decided to code a Tic Tac Toe game using the rules from
[this website](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/). Basically, the game represents nine individual tic 
tac toe boards that generate one larger board that is the actual playing field. A move by any player results in a restriction for 
the other player to only move in one of the other boards, if it is playable. 

It's a bit of a mess managing everything since there are 81 buttons in the game, but with a bit of Excel work most code
writes itself. Using a ConstraintLayout also simplified a lot of stuff, primarily the gridlines.
